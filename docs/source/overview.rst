summary

A highly constrained, yet flexible and intuitive knowledgebase:

- Benefits from the intuitive expressiveness, strong constraints and powerful inference of Grakn's datamodel
- Upper and mid-level ontology based on Basic Formal Ontology ensures that all models are rigourous and mutually compatible
- A modular domain-level ontology library provides plug-and-play ontologies for different subject-matters, levels of abstract and spatiotemporal dimensions.
- A schema design tool makes it easy to match existing csv or JSON data to Grakn concept types and import data
- Logical rules infer implicit relations in the data and a text-mining based model adds semantic connections
- Query and visualize the data using an intuitive graphical interface
