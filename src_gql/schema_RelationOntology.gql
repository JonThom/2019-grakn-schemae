# Relation Ontology
# NB: Overall, the Relation Ontology has certain issues
# - does not seem to be stable
# - not modular, with very low-level relations, not a mid- but domain-level
# - unclear sub- and superclassing wrt BFO / ROcore, and overlap
# - The relations seem innsufficiently subclassed. Maybe due
# to actually needing to avoid inheritance when specifying subclass
# as a special case
# (see RO Guide https://github.com/oborel/obo-relations/wiki/ROGuide)
# Therefore only use certain generic relations and add domain-specific classes
# as required (or by adding new domain ontologies that include them)
